  content: `FARMEX Corporation was officially awarded the Learning Site for Agriculture I (LSA I) Certificate by the Agricultural Training Institute \u2013 CALABARZON (ATI-CALABARZON) on May 2, 2025, during a ceremony held at its station in Brgy. Bangyas, Calauan, Laguna.

The event featured key messages from ATI-CALABARZON Center Director Dr. Rolando V. Maningas, FARMEX Chief Operations Officer Mr. Arturo A. Alejar, and Ms. Angelica A. Belarmino, Operations Manager and LSA cooperator, along with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two organizations.

\u201CAng kasunduang ito ay tanda ng pagsisimula ng ating pagtutulungan upang higit nating maabot ang mga magsasakang Pilipino at mapabuti ang kanilang kabuhayan sa pamamagitan ng pagpapalaganap ng mga makabago at angkop na teknolohiya sa pagsasaka,\u201D said Dir. Rolando V. Maningas during his message at the event.

FARMEX also presented its plans for facility and project development as an LSA through Ms. Myrille T. Adlus (Business Development Manager) and Engr. Karlo Miguel Santos (LEADSTECH Operations Manager).

This was followed by the unveiling of the LSA billboard, a guided tour of the farm and its facilities, and a photo opportunity. As an accredited Learning Site, FARMEX will now serve as a hub for knowledge sharing, sustainable farming practices, and farmer capacity-building in the region.

The event was facilitated by ATI-CALABARZON staff, led by Ms. Abbie del Rosario, Partnerships and Accreditation Section Chief, and Ms. Soledad E. Leal, Agriculturist II and ATI-LSA Focal Person. It was witnessed by executives from the LEADS Group of Companies, including Senior Vice President Romeo Obcena Jr., HR Director Almicko Reyes, Engr. Kelvin Chryzth Velasquez (Chief HR and Transformation Officer of Malveda Holdings Corporation), and Vice President for Finance Catalina Malveda.

The Learning Site for Agriculture (LSA) program is one of ATI\u2019s strategies to promote sustainable and practical agriculture through farm-based learning. An LSA I is a private farm accredited by ATI to serve as a model learning venue where farmers and stakeholders can observe, learn, and adopt best practices and technologies in agriculture.

FARMEX Corporation, a newly ATI-Certified Learning Site for Agriculture I (LSA I), proudly hosted its first batch of farmer training following the official awarding of its LSA I certificate last May. The five-day course, conducted by the Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Training Institute (DA-ATI) CALABARZON, was held on June 9\u201313, 2025, and focused on strengthening the capabilities of farmers in harvest and post-harvest management to improve Rice Processing Center (RPC) operations.

Held at the FARMEX demonstration site in Brgy. Bangyas, Calauan, Laguna, the training brought together 25 farmer-leaders from different rice clusters/associations in Rizal and Quezon provinces. The activity was conducted in partnership with the Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization (PhilMech) and the Coalition Alliance of Farmers in Santa Cruz, Laguna (CAFSCL).

The training program included lectures, field demonstrations, and hands-on activities covering the correct use and maintenance of vital post-harvest machinery such as multi-stage rice mills and mechanical dryers. These sessions aimed to help reduce post-harvest losses, enhance grain quality, and improve the overall efficiency of community-based RPCs.

Dr. Rolando V. Maningas, Center Director of DA-ATI CALABARZON, personally attended the closing program and delivered an inspiring message to the participants. He encouraged them to apply their newly acquired knowledge in their farming communities and to serve as advocates of improved rice post-harvest practices.

As a newly certified LSA I, FARMEX Corporation is honored to contribute to the capacity-building of Filipino farmers and remains committed to supporting ATI\u2019s mission of empowering rural communities through training, innovation, and sustainable agricultural practices.`

The festivities also included a Street Dancing Competition, with students from various high schools showcasing vibrant performances, and the much-anticipated Binibining Licab 2025 beauty pageant.

Through their participation, LAV, together with LEADS Agricultural Products Corporation, reaffirmed their commitment to empowering Filipino farmers by providing high-quality seeds, agrochemicals, and innovative farming solutions. Jackpot 102, known for its exceptional yield and grain quality, remains a preferred choice among farmers in Nueva Ecija and beyond.

The return of the Kariton Festival after a five-year hiatus due to COVID-19 was a significant moment for the community. LEADS Agriventures Corporation\u2019s participation was made possible through the initiative of Mr. Randolph Diaz, with the strong support of Chief Operations Officer Mr. Arturo A. Alejar Jr. and Business Development Manager Ms. Myrille T. Adlus.
